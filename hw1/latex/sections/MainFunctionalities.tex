\section{Main Functionalities}
%What are the main functionalities of the web app? what services does it offer and how it is organized?

The main functionalities rotate around users and their ratings of books they read and searching for new book to read. Keeping this in mind we want a database to store information both of books (with a main focus on "book", "author" and "publisher") and users (with an eye on the rating mechanic).\\
For the presentation and the UI the idea is to keep things simple: in the main page there will be a search bar on top, with different rows of books below it; each rows is a different category of suggested book (top 5 rated, top 5 read, ...) and alternatively you can search in the search bar either user, author or title of book.\\
